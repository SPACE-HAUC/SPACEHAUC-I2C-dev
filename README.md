SparkFun PWM Block for Edison C++ Library
========================================

The SparkFun PWM Block allows you to add 8 channels of I<sup>2</sup>C controlled
PWM to your Edison stack. This library, and the example code included with it,
will get you started working with the PCA9685 chip on the block. It provides
functions for generic control as well as application specific code for driving
LEDs and servo motors.

Repository Contents
