 * SparkFun_PWM_Edison_Block_Example.cpp
 * Example code showing how to use the SparkFun PWM Edison Block
 * Mike Hord @ SparkFun Electronics
 * 9 June 2015
 * https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_PWM_Block_for_Edison_CPP_Library
 *
 * This file is a demonstration program showing the various functions that we've
 * provided for working with the PCA9685 IC on the SparkFun PWM Edison Block.
 * It uses an RGB LED and a small servo motor to show what the library can do.
 *
 * Resources:
 * Requires Intel's MRAA framework. This can be downloaded from either the
 * GitHub site (https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa) or in pre-built form
 * from http://iotdk.intel.com/sdk/mraa-update/.
 *
 * Development environment specifics:
 * Developed in the Intel iot-ide-dk Eclipse on Win 7 (v1.0.0.201502201135)
 * Using lib-mraa v0.6.2
 * On Edison poky-linux image build ww18-15
 *
 * This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
 * local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
